CachesMethod
============

This plugin lets you cache a method's execution for a specified period of time (defaults to 15) or until a method is called.

Unfortunately, right now, you have to put the caches_method call *after* the related methods have been defined. If anyone has a suggestion how to alias a method before it's defined, it would be welcomed.

The plugin was inspired by @bdainton, from this blog post:
http://buddingrubyist.com/2008/10/14/alias_method_chaining-your-ar-associations-for-fun-and-profit/


Example
=======

To use it:

Class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
	def takeover_world
		#REALLY INTENSIVE STUFF
	end

	def retreat
		#not so intense
	end
	
	caches_method :some_expensive_method, :expire_methods => [:retreat], :ttl => 2000.years
end
